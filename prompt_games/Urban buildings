A port near the sea without a sandy beach, featuring night views
The seafront unfolds the city's nightscape, with buildings of varying heights and shapes stretching out front and back.
In the foreground, buildings around 15 stories tall rise at different heights, while in the background, skyscrapers over 40 stories soar at varying heights.
Slightly to the left of center, a nighttime Ferris wheel with lights on is operating atop a wooden deck.
At the far right end of the wooden deck stands a building called PIER56.
To the left of the Ferris wheel, an American flag flutters in the breeze.
In front of the wooden deck, the tranquil sea stretches out.

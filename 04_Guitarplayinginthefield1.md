```
A man in his 40s wearing a black short-sleeved shirt and dark jeans.
His hair falls below his shoulders, tied back in a single ponytail with a black elastic band.
He wears yellow horn-rimmed glasses, and his beard completely covers the area below his chin.
He plays a dark brown electric guitar slung over his left shoulder.
The man is turned to the right, showing only his left side, with his torso facing right.
The background features lush, dry grass surrounding the area, with low mountains visible in the distance. The background is in focus-out mode.
The sky is clear and cloudless, a bright blue sky typical of around 3 PM.
